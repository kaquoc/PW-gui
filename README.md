# Password-Manager
This password-manager is my own version implemented upon the encryption method and JSON database in my 411_Password_Manager, collaborating with Phillip Budiman 
and Nathanial Bland as a final project for CS411.

The code for the final project for CS411 can be found in the 411_Password_Manager repository.

This Password Manager has no affiliation with any BU CS course and is a continuation of the encryption concepts and JSON database that I've learn in my final project
for CS411.

My goal for this version of Password Manager is to build upon the encryption and JSON database established in the final project. I want to create a new GUI with 
JavaFX and SceneBuilder and add further functionalities to my password manager.
